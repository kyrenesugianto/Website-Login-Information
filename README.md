# Website-Login-Information

In this project, the focus was on the implementation of hashtable functionality for secure storage of website login information. The primary tasks involved constructing the ArrayHashTable class, addressing TODOs in methods such as constructors, size tracking, put, get, and remove. Additionally, attention was given to the LinearCollisionHandler and QuadraticCollisionHandler classes to ensure effective collision resolution.

The project centered around the practical application of hashtables in the context of securely storing user login credentialsâ€”pairing each username with an encrypted password. The encryption process was facilitated using the Java MessageDigest class, adhering to industry-standard security practices. The resultant system enabled users to create accounts, view the database, delete accounts, and change passwords. The V menu option played a crucial role in debugging and gaining insights into encrypted password strings.

The coding process was characterized by incremental steps, emphasizing the implementation of fundamental methods like put, get, and remove. Consideration was given to load factors and dynamic resizing of the hashtable, with exploration of advanced collision resolution strategies outlined in the QuadraticCollisionHandler class.

In summary, this project aimed at the systematic implementation of hashtable features, focusing on secure storage and retrieval of website login information. The emphasis was on functionality, efficiency, and real-world applicability.
